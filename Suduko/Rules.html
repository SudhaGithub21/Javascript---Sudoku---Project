                        <p class="text3"> A Sudoku puzzle is played on a 9x9 grid, which means it has 81 cells in total (9 rows and 9 columns).
                            This grid is further divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, also called regions or blocks. 
                            Each subgrid consists of 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 formation.
                            The objective of Sudoku is to fill each cell of the 9x9 grid with a number from 1 to 9.ith a number from 1 to 9.
                            These digits must be placed in such a way that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains each digit exactly once. 
                            In each row of the 9x9 grid, you must have the numbers 1 through 9 appearing once and only once.
                            In each column of the 9x9 grid, the numbers 1 through 9 must also appear exactly once.
                            Within each 3x3 subgrid, the numbers 1 through 9 should appear exactly once.

                        <h3 class="Rules1">Suduko Rule No 2: No Repetition</h3> 
                        
                        <p class="text3"> In Sudoku, the rule of no repetition forms the core of the puzzle's challenge and logic. 
                            This means that no row can contain the same number more than once, no column can repeat a number, and each 3x3 subgrid must also have all nine digits without repetition.
                            For instance, placing a '1' in a particular row means that '1' cannot appear in any other cell of that row. Similarly, 
                            placing a '5' in a specific column precludes placing another '5' in any other cell of that column. 
                            This rule forces players to think ahead and strategize their moves to maintain the puzzle's integrity and ultimately 
                            arrive at a unique solution where every cell in the grid is correctly filled according to the rules.

                        <p class="text3"> Logical deduction in Sudoku involves using a systematic approach to fill in numbers based on the game's rules.
                        Players start with given numbers and strategically place digits from 1 to 9 in empty cells across rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids. 
                        Techniques include elimination, where candidates are ruled out based on existing numbers in the same row, column, or subgrid. 
                        Sole candidate and unique possibility methods identify cells with only one viable number left, while subset exclusion pinpoints 
                        groups of cells where specific numbers must appear, excluding them from others in the unit. More complex strategies like chains and 
                        loops trace patterns of possible placements, ensuring every number fits precisely without guessing, making Sudoku a challenging yet 
                        rewarding exercise in logical reasoning.

                            <p class="text3">Every well-constructed Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution that can be reached through pure 
                                logical deduction. Guessing should not be necessary to solve a Sudoku puzzle.The puzzle is considered 
                                solved when all 81 cells of the grid are filled with digits from 1 to 9, adhering to the rules of 
                                non-repetition across rows, columns, and subgrids.While the standard Sudoku uses a 9x9 grid, 
                                there are variations such as 4x4, 6x6, 12x12, and others. The rules generally remain the same,
                                 with the grid size and number range adjusted accordingly.
