Hello! I'm Sudha, a passionate computer science graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently focused on expanding my skills in Python full-stack development. My goal is to integrate my knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies to create seamless user experiences and impactful digital solutions.I am fortunate to be part of Hejex Technology, where I am actively advancing my knowledge and skills under their guidance.

To further enrich my front-end development skills, I have embarked on a project to create a Sudoku game website using JavaScript. 
      
     • Created a simple sudoku game website by referring to online resources which helped to understand the JavaScript concepts.  
     • Comprehensive Knowledge of JavaScript frameworks, DOM manipulation, and interactive web applications.
     • Additionally, included the timer to the game which finishes the game when time is up, and implemented a mistake 
      limit which also terminates the game if it is exceeded. The timer, which I created to improve the user experience 
      overall begins to run when a number is clicked.	
     • CSS class names were implemented in JavaScript to apply CSS styles and to provide access to HTML components 
	and their styles to manipulating their appearance and behavior.
