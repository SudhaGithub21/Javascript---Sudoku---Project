Hello! I'm Sudha, a passionate computer science graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently focused on expanding my skills in Python full-stack development. My goal is to integrate my knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies to create seamless user experiences and impactful digital solutions.I am fortunate to be part of Hejex Technology, where I am actively advancing my knowledge and skills under their guidance.

To further enrich my front-end development skills, I have embarked on a project to create a Sudoku game website using JavaScript. 
      • Sudoku, with intricate logic and user interaction components, serves as an excellent platform.                                                                              
      • To deepen my understanding of JavaScript frameworks, DOM manipulation, and interactive web applications.                                       
      • JavaScript allowed access to HTML elements and their styles, enabling manipulation of their appearance and behavior.
      • In JavaScript, implemented CSS class names to apply styles defined in CSS.
